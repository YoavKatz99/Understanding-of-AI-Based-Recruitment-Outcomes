# Understanding AI-Based Recruitment Outcomes

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to enhance transparency in AI-driven recruitment by using **Explainable AI (XAI)** techniques such as **SHAP, LIME, and Counterfactual Explanations (CARLA)**. By applying these tools to resume evaluation, we help candidates understand how their applications are assessed and why they receive specific outcomes.

By analyzing data from resumes, we will present how key factors like skills and experience impact job matches. The project will provide clear visual and textual explanations to help candidates understand why their CV received a specific evaluation. Our goal is to make the recruitment process clearer, and more effective.
